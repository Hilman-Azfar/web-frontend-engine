# web-frontend-engine

Repository for the web frontend engine

-   UI components based on <a href="https://github.com/LifeSG/react-design-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React design system</a>
-   Form generation via JSON schema

The intention of frontend engine is to take out the heavy lifting of form development and offer a collection of common fields so engineers can develop forms quickly. The form will be defined through a JSON schema so non-engineers can customise the form as well.
